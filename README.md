IBM Z System Automation collection
==================================

The **IBM Z System Automation collection**, also represented as **ibm_zos_sysauto** in this document,
is preparing to become a part of the broader offering Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z.

The **IBM Z System Automation collection** consists of roles and sample playbooks that you can use with the
[Operations REST server component](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/de/SSWRCJ_4.2.0/com.ibm.safos.doc_4.2/Integrating.html)
of IBM Z System Automation.

This collection allows Ansible to create and delete [dynamic resources](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/de/SSWRCJ_4.2.0/com.ibm.safos.doc_4.2/UserGuide/Dynamic_Resources.html)
from a template defined in the current active policy of an IBM Z System Automation environment.
It interacts with IBM Z System Automation with help of its Operations REST API.

Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z provides the ability to connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise
automation strategy through the Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem.
This enables development and operations automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in one easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM Z System Automation collection**, as planned to be part of the broader offering
Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z, is available on Galaxy as community supported.

For guides and reference, please visit [the documentation site](https://ansible-collections.github.io/ibm_zos_sysauto/index.html).

Please note: It is IBM's intention to further test and certify the **IBM Z System Automation collection**
once more testing and community feedback is provided.*
