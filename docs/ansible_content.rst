IBM Z System Automation
=======================

The **IBM Z System Automation collection**, also represented as **ibm_zos_sysauto**
in this document, consists of roles and sample playbooks that you can use with the
`Operations REST server component`_ of IBM Z System Automation.

This collection allows Ansible to create and delete `dynamic resources`_
from a template defined in the current active policy of an IBM Z System Automation environment.
It interacts with IBM Z System Automation with help of its Operations REST API.
